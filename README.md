## How does it work ?

This Streamlit cloud app is designed for data analysis and includes six pages:

1. Data Cleaning App Page: This page allows the user to clean missing values in the dataset. The user can choose the data set and apply different cleaning techniques to handle missing values.

2. Data Encoding App Page: This page allows the user to encode categorical variables in the dataset. The user can choose the data set and apply different encoding techniques to handle categorical variables.

3. Data Visualization App Page: This page allows the user to visualize the data set. The user can choose the data set and visualize it using different visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps.

4. ML Model Selection App Page: This page allows the user to select the appropriate machine learning model based on the problem type. The user can choose the data set and select the problem type (classification, regression, or time series) to find the best machine learning model.

5. AutoML for Regression App Page: This page allows the user to perform automated machine learning (AutoML) for regression problems using lazyRegression. The user can choose the data set, select the target variable, and run the AutoML algorithm.

6. AutoML for Classification App Page: This page allows the user to perform automated machine learning (AutoML) for classification problems using lazyClassifier. The user can choose the data set, select the target variable, and run the AutoML algorithm.
